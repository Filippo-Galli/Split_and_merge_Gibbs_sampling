This repository contains the code to implement the methods and reproduce the results presented in the paper "Model-based clustering of categorical data based on the Hamming distance".

1. The sub-directory `data` contains the data files.
2. The sub-directory `code` holds source code files that contain the core code to implement the method and various utility/auxiliary functions.
3. The sub-directory `realdata_analysis` contains the R-scripts to run the real data analysis described in the paper.
4. The sub-directory `simulation_studies` contains the R-scripts to run the simulation experiments described in the paper. In particular, the script MAIN_simulation reproduces the simulation study in the paper.

> *IMPORTANT*:
> To enable the debug print the bool variable is into `code/common_function.R`
